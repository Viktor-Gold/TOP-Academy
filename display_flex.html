    <div class="book">Incredible mystical events suddenly take place in the Tretyakov family's large noble house. On the
        landing, for
        no reason at all, a statue of a woman, a goddess, falls and breaks! The whole family began to discuss what would
        happen? What kind of bad event is going to happen? All this is for a reason. The event happened the next day.
        The Bolsheviks seized power by making a coup.
        The Tretyakov family discussed for a long time the events that took place in the Russian Empire, what to do, how
        to live on? Grandma immediately insisted on hiding everything of value in a special niche, right here in the
        house behind the wall. So they did, and then decided to wait it out for now, to understand how it would end.
        The father of the family, Vladimir Mikhailovich Tretyakov, was a track engineer (a profession necessary at that
        time and very rare). He continued to work day after day and the workers respected him very much. Olga Tretyakova
        – taught languages, she knew English, German, French and Russian. She was very hardworking and responsible.
        Other family members also lived in the House: five-year-old daughter Irina, three-year-old son Igor and
        grandmother Victoria Tretyakova-Safonova.
        After 1918, the Tretyakov house was confiscated and only 3 rooms on the 3rd floor were left to the family. A
        pharmacy was built on the ground floor. The rest of the rooms were occupied by families of workers, each family
        was given a room.
        One day Dmitry Mikhailovich went on a trolley with workers to check the railway and did not return. My wife was
        restless for several days and decided to tell fortunes in front of the mirror. In that mirror, she saw candles
        in the coffin. After some time, three corpses were found in the forest belt, not far from the railroad track.
        The bodies were identified, they were two workers and V.M. Tretyakov. They said that they were killed by some
        "green" bandits. Vladimir Mikhailovich was buried with honors, as he worked for the Soviet government. Olga
        Fridrikhovna was offered to teach foreign languages to party workers. Grandmother Victoria was very worried
        after the loss of her son and became very ill. The wife of the deceased tried to control herself for the sake of
        the children. Gradually, she began to get used to her new job.
        When the grandmother died, the children were assigned to kindergarten. And Olga Friedrichovna meets her second
        love, Emmanuel Ilyich Kazas. His wife died and he left two children, Ilya and Erna. Kazas picks up Olga and the
        children and transports them to Bakhchisarai. He was appointed director of the Tobacco Factory there. They lived
        well, the house was large and cozy, even had their own servants. Olga and Emmanuel loved each other very much.
        The children were already in school, they studied well, the girls Ira and Erna grew up, they were very friendly
        and well-mannered. Ilya loved Irina very much, always stood up for her, looked after her and looked after her.
        Igor did not like Ilya. The boys often quarreled, sometimes they didn't talk for weeks. If there was something
        to say to each other, they talked like this: "Stepa, tell Igor that he needs to go to his mother, she called
        him." There was strict order and regime in the house. If the children played too much and were late for lunch,
        they were left without lunch. One day the children got too busy and forgot about lunch. Irina and Erna climbed
        into the attic of the house, and Igor and Ilya were downstairs in the yard. At that time, the servants came out
        and began to invite the children to dinner. The boys made it, but the girls went down – they were too late, (IN
        MORE DETAIL! HOW DID YOU STAY WITHOUT LUNCH? WAS THE DOOR SLAMMED IN FRONT OF THEM OR WHAT?) and they were left
        without lunch. Then the boys brought out a cutlet with bread for the girls. Ilya is for Ira, and Igor is for
        Erna. 1938 came, which destroyed everything. Kazas's brother, Dmitry Ulyanov (Brother of V.I. Lenin), who came
        to him as a doctor to a doctor, was repressed. And then Emmanuel Ilyich Kazas himself. They came for him at
        night, asked him to pack his things for the road and dress well. When ready, he was taken away and what happened
        to him next is unknown. His children, Erna and Ilya, were taken by relatives to Moscow. Olga moved with Ira and
        Igor to Simferopol. They gave her an apartment there and she taught foreign languages again. Of course, she
        tried to find out anything about her husband, but no one knew anything. Irina's daughter was very worried and
        shed a lot of tears, she fell in love with Ilya and Erna very much. Ira couldn't believe that she might never
        see them again. Olga's grandmother has a terrible fate. To lose a second husband, reliable, faithful and
        beloved.
        Igor has already studied at the Federal Law (TRANSCRIPT?) He worked as a baker, after graduation he worked at a
        bakery. Irina graduated from seven classes and accounting courses. She worked at the pedagogical Institute as an
        accountant. In 1939, Igor got married, and a year later his daughter Tamara was born. Igor lived badly with his
        wife Zoya, she loved drinking, partying and arranged them almost every day. Zoya worked as a barmaid.
        In 1942, when the Germans invaded Simferopol, but they were not yet in the city itself, Igor was arrested (WERE
        the RUSSIANS ARRESTED?) because he was the son of a Russian German woman, and his father was a nobleman – a
        white Aryan. Igor was exiled to Kolyma for 10 years without the right to correspond. Zoya was already pregnant
        with her second child. In the same year, she gave birth to a girl, who died of pneumonia three months later.
        After the funeral of her second daughter, Zoya took Tamara to an orphanage, and she walked around and looked for
        a new husband. Igor didn't even know that he had a second daughter. He managed to survive in the Kolyma camp,
        thanks to the prison governor, who was not indifferent to him. At first, the boss treated him badly. I sent him
        to do all sorts of dirty work, like stacking corpses. Then Igor lost heart, he thought that his end was coming
        soon. But then he caught a cold and fell ill, and after the infirmary, the warden took him in with the words:
        "Do you want to live? You will live and work with me. I'm going out, I'll feed you, but for one small favor. I
        like you, I love looking into your blue eyes, I love your facial features, your voice, you sing thug songs well,
        I love your body after all! You understand me, what kind of service is required of you! Well, are you silent,
        did you not expect it? Okay, you can think about it, because I see you are completely stunned /dumbfounded. Yes,
        friend, don't be surprised. If you want to live, agree!" – "That's how I survived," Igor said when he told this
        story to his sister Irina and did not tell anyone else about it. However, the jailers found out and egged him
        on. Igor was very angry at one of them, who took him out too often, and sewed him on. For which he received an
        extra sentence in addition to 10 years. He was released only in 1953/1958, under amnesty after Stalin's death.
        Igor came To Simferopol, his wife was married to another, his daughter was in a children's home, his mother Olga
        Fridrikhovna died in 1952. He took his daughter from the children's home and came to Taganrog to his sister
        Irina, who lived in Aunt Katya's apartment. Igor went to work, married a woman with an apartment, whose name was
        also Zoya. She had her own daughter, Lyudochka. So they began to live as a friendly family (Lyudochka was also
        taken from her childhood home, she lived in the village with her grandmother). However, Igor was ill with
        tuberculosis after prison and often lay in the hospital, in dispensaries. He was already an imperfectly healthy
        man, he had skin and bones on him. Prison took away his health, his wife, his education, he did not see how his
        daughter grew up, who ended up in an orphanage. Tamara was born in 1940 and lived in a country house until 1956
        (WHEN IGOR GOT OUT OF PRISON?). Until her repressed father, my uncle Igor, my mother's brother, born in 1914,
        was released.
        When we were in Simferopol, we visited Tamara at her house. They didn't let her out to us, but she climbed the
        fence and we could see her, talk to her. She was very happy that she was not living with her drunkard mother and
        her lovers. She was fed and dressed well, no one offended her, at least that's what she told us.

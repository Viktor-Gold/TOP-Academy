    <div class="book">Incredible mystical events suddenly take place in the Tretyakov family's large noble house. On the
        landing, for
        no reason at all, a statue of a woman, a goddess, falls and breaks! The whole family began to discuss what would
        happen? What kind of bad event is going to happen? All this is for a reason. The event happened the next day.
        The Bolsheviks seized power by making a coup.
        The Tretyakov family discussed for a long time the events that took place in the Russian Empire, what to do, how
        to live on? Grandma immediately insisted on hiding everything of value in a special niche, right here in the
        house behind the wall. So they did, and then decided to wait it out for now, to understand how it would end.
        The father of the family, Vladimir Mikhailovich Tretyakov, was a track engineer (a profession necessary at that
        time and very rare). He continued to work day after day and the workers respected him very much. Olga Tretyakova
        – taught languages, she knew English, German, French and Russian. She was very hardworking and responsible.
        Other family members also lived in the House: five-year-old daughter Irina, three-year-old son Igor and
        grandmother Victoria Tretyakova-Safonova.
        After 1918, the Tretyakov house was confiscated and only 3 rooms on the 3rd floor were left to the family. A
        pharmacy was built on the ground floor. The rest of the rooms were occupied by families of workers, each family
        was given a room.
        One day Dmitry Mikhailovich went on a trolley with workers to check the railway and did not return. My wife was
        restless for several days and decided to tell fortunes in front of the mirror. In that mirror, she saw candles
        in the coffin. After some time, three corpses were found in the forest belt, not far from the railroad track.
        The bodies were identified, they were two workers and V.M. Tretyakov. They said that they were killed by some
        "green" bandits. Vladimir Mikhailovich was buried with honors, as he worked for the Soviet government. Olga
        Fridrikhovna was offered to teach foreign languages to party workers. Grandmother Victoria was very worried
        after the loss of her son and became very ill. The wife of the deceased tried to control herself for the sake of
        the children. Gradually, she began to get used to her new job.
        When the grandmother died, the children were assigned to kindergarten. And Olga Friedrichovna meets her second
        love, Emmanuel Ilyich Kazas. His wife died and he left two children, Ilya and Erna. Kazas picks up Olga and the
        children and transports them to Bakhchisarai. He was appointed director of the Tobacco Factory there. They lived
        well, the house was large and cozy, even had their own servants. Olga and Emmanuel loved each other very much.
        The children were already in school, they studied well, the girls Ira and Erna grew up, they were very friendly
        and well-mannered. Ilya loved Irina very much, always stood up for her, looked after her and looked after her.
        Igor did not like Ilya. The boys often quarreled, sometimes they didn't talk for weeks. If there was something
        to say to each other, they talked like this: "Stepa, tell Igor that he needs to go to his mother, she called
        him." There was strict order and regime in the house. If the children played too much and were late for lunch,
        they were left without lunch. One day the children got too busy and forgot about lunch. Irina and Erna climbed
        into the attic of the house, and Igor and Ilya were downstairs in the yard. At that time, the servants came out
        and began to invite the children to dinner. The boys made it, but the girls went down – they were too late, (IN
        MORE DETAIL! HOW DID YOU STAY WITHOUT LUNCH? WAS THE DOOR SLAMMED IN FRONT OF THEM OR WHAT?) and they were left
        without lunch. Then the boys brought out a cutlet with bread for the girls. Ilya is for Ira, and Igor is for
        Erna. 1938 came, which destroyed everything. Kazas's brother, Dmitry Ulyanov (Brother of V.I. Lenin), who came
        to him as a doctor to a doctor, was repressed. And then Emmanuel Ilyich Kazas himself. They came for him at
        night, asked him to pack his things for the road and dress well. When ready, he was taken away and what happened
        to him next is unknown. His children, Erna and Ilya, were taken by relatives to Moscow. Olga moved with Ira and
        Igor to Simferopol. They gave her an apartment there and she taught foreign languages again. Of course, she
        tried to find out anything about her husband, but no one knew anything. Irina's daughter was very worried and
        shed a lot of tears, she fell in love with Ilya and Erna very much. Ira couldn't believe that she might never
        see them again. Olga's grandmother has a terrible fate. To lose a second husband, reliable, faithful and
        beloved.
        Igor has already studied at the Federal Law (TRANSCRIPT?) He worked as a baker, after graduation he worked at a
        bakery. Irina graduated from seven classes and accounting courses. She worked at the pedagogical Institute as an
        accountant. In 1939, Igor got married, and a year later his daughter Tamara was born. Igor lived badly with his
        wife Zoya, she loved drinking, partying and arranged them almost every day. Zoya worked as a barmaid.
        In 1942, when the Germans invaded Simferopol, but they were not yet in the city itself, Igor was arrested (WERE
        the RUSSIANS ARRESTED?) because he was the son of a Russian German woman, and his father was a nobleman – a
        white Aryan. Igor was exiled to Kolyma for 10 years without the right to correspond. Zoya was already pregnant
        with her second child. In the same year, she gave birth to a girl, who died of pneumonia three months later.
        After the funeral of her second daughter, Zoya took Tamara to an orphanage, and she walked around and looked for
        a new husband. Igor didn't even know that he had a second daughter. He managed to survive in the Kolyma camp,
        thanks to the prison governor, who was not indifferent to him. At first, the boss treated him badly. I sent him
        to do all sorts of dirty work, like stacking corpses. Then Igor lost heart, he thought that his end was coming
        soon. But then he caught a cold and fell ill, and after the infirmary, the warden took him in with the words:
        "Do you want to live? You will live and work with me. I'm going out, I'll feed you, but for one small favor. I
        like you, I love looking into your blue eyes, I love your facial features, your voice, you sing thug songs well,
        I love your body after all! You understand me, what kind of service is required of you! Well, are you silent,
        did you not expect it? Okay, you can think about it, because I see you are completely stunned /dumbfounded. Yes,
        friend, don't be surprised. If you want to live, agree!" – "That's how I survived," Igor said when he told this
        story to his sister Irina and did not tell anyone else about it. However, the jailers found out and egged him
        on. Igor was very angry at one of them, who took him out too often, and sewed him on. For which he received an
        extra sentence in addition to 10 years. He was released only in 1953/1958, under amnesty after Stalin's death.
        Igor came To Simferopol, his wife was married to another, his daughter was in a children's home, his mother Olga
        Fridrikhovna died in 1952. He took his daughter from the children's home and came to Taganrog to his sister
        Irina, who lived in Aunt Katya's apartment. Igor went to work, married a woman with an apartment, whose name was
        also Zoya. She had her own daughter, Lyudochka. So they began to live as a friendly family (Lyudochka was also
        taken from her childhood home, she lived in the village with her grandmother). However, Igor was ill with
        tuberculosis after prison and often lay in the hospital, in dispensaries. He was already an imperfectly healthy
        man, he had skin and bones on him. Prison took away his health, his wife, his education, he did not see how his
        daughter grew up, who ended up in an orphanage. Tamara was born in 1940 and lived in a country house until 1956
        (WHEN IGOR GOT OUT OF PRISON?). Until her repressed father, my uncle Igor, my mother's brother, born in 1914,
        was released.
        When we were in Simferopol, we visited Tamara at her house. They didn't let her out to us, but she climbed the
        fence and we could see her, talk to her. She was very happy that she was not living with her drunkard mother and
        her lovers. She was fed and dressed well, no one offended her, at least that's what she told us.

        <h2>Computer programming</h2>
        <hr>
        <i>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</i>

        <p><b>Computer programming</b> is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for
            accomplishing a specific computing task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating
            algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in
            a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in
            one or more languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate
            the performance of a task on a computer, often for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus
            often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain,
            specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>

        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Programmable devices have existed at least as far back as 1206 AD, when the automata of Al-Jazari were
            programmable, via pegs and cams, to play various rhythms and drum patterns; and the 1801 Jacquard loom could
            produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" - a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in
            them.</p>

        <p>However, the first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an
            algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's
            Analytical Engine. Women would continue to dominate the field of computer programming until the mid 1960s.</p>

        <p>In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form. Later a control
            panel (plugboard) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the
            late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a
            similar way; as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computers
            introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.</p>

        <p>Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine, often
            in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a text
            format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying
            addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine
            language, any two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages. Kathleen
            Booth created one of the first Assembly languages in 1950 for various computers at Birkbeck College.</p>

        <hr>
        <h3>Quality requirements</h3>
        <p>Whatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. The
            following properties are among the most important:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Reliability: how often the results of a program are correct. This depends on conceptual correctness of
                algorithms, and minimization of programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management (e.g., buffer
                overflows and race conditions) and logic errors (such as division by zero or off-by-one errors).</li>
            <li>Robustness: how well a program anticipates problems due to errors (not bugs). This includes situations such as
                incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory, operating system
                services and network connections, user error, and unexpected power outages.</li>
            <li>Usability: the ergonomics of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its intended
                purpose or in some cases even unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success even regardless
                of other issues. This involves a wide range of textual, graphical and sometimes hardware elements that improve
                the clarity, intuitiveness, cohesiveness and completeness of a program's user interface.</li>
            <li> Portability: the range of computer hardware and operating system platforms on which the source code of a program
                can be compiled/interpreted and run. This depends on differences in the programming facilities provided by the
                different platforms, including hardware and operating system resources, expected behavior of the hardware and
                operating system, and availability of platform specific compilers (and sometimes libraries) for the language of
                the source code.</li>
            <li>Maintainability: the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in order to
                make improvements or customizations, fix bugs and security holes, or adapt it to new environments. Good
                practices[24] during initial development make the difference in this regard. This quality may not be directly
                apparent to the end user but it can significantly affect the fate of a program over the long term.</li>
            <li> Efficiency/performance: Measure of system resources a program consumes (processor time, memory space, slow
                devices such as disks, network bandwidth and to some extent even user interaction): the less, the better. This
                also includes careful management of resources, for example cleaning up temporary files and eliminating memory
                leaks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Readability of source code</h3>
        <p>In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose,
            control flow, and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability,
            usability and most importantly maintainability.</p>

        <p>Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying to understand and
            modifying existing source code, rather than writing new source code. Unreadable code often leads to bugs,
            inefficiencies, and duplicated code. A study[25] found that a few simple readability transformations made code
            shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it.</p>

        <h3>Algorithmic complexity</h3>
        <p>The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with
            discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problem. For this purpose,
            algorithms are classified into orders using so-called Big O notation, which expresses resource use, such as
            execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with a
            variety of well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose
            algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances.</p>

        <h3>Chess algorithms as an example</h3>
        <p>"Programming a Computer for Playing Chess" was a 1950 paper that evaluated a "minimax" algorithm that is part of
            the history of algorithmic complexity; a course on IBM's Deep Blue (chess computer) is part of the computer
            science curriculum at Stanford University.[27]</p>

        <h2 id="programming_languages">Programming languages</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Different programming languages support different styles of programming (called programming paradigms). The
            choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task,
            availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best suited
            for the task at hand will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know
            the language to build a team, the availability of compilers for that language, and the efficiency with which
            programs written in a given language execute. Languages form an approximate spectrum from "low-level" to
            "high-level"; "low-level" languages are typically more machine-oriented and faster to execute, whereas
            "high-level" languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly. It is usually easier to
            code in "high-level" languages than in "low-level" ones.</p>

        <h2 id="programmers">Programmers</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Computer programmers are those who write computer software. Their jobs usually involve:</p>
